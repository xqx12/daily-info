The software could be developed as a honeypot for detection of exploitation attempts within a network and/or as a practice server for pentesters.  The project may also need to develop companion software that can test the code, or collect logs from the server.% | https://github.com/TimHanneman/Multi_Purpose_Exploitable_Server | 0 | 0|
