| 20210603T12:21:19Z | cve-2021-21985 | cve-2021-21985 exploit | https://github.com/xnianq/cve-2021-21985_exp | The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to lack of input validation in the Virtual SAN Health Check plug-in which is enabled by default in vCenter Server. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server.| 
| 20210603T11:37:30Z | CVE-2020-7471 | PoC for the SQL injection vulnerability in PostgreSQL with Django, found in Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 | https://github.com/huzaifakhan771/CVE-2020-7471-Django | Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.| 
| 20210603T11:07:56Z | CVE-2021-21985 | CVE-2021-21985 vmware vcenter 远程代码执行 EXP | https://github.com/r0ckysec/CVE-2021-21985 | The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to lack of input validation in the Virtual SAN Health Check plug-in which is enabled by default in vCenter Server.

| 20210603T09:50:31Z | CVE-2020-24949 | PHPFusion 9.03.50 - Remote Code Execution | https://github.com/r90tpass/CVE-2020-24949 | Privilege escalation in PHP-Fusion 9.03.50 downloads/downloads.php allows an authenticated user (not admin) to send a crafted request to the server and perform remote command execution (RCE).| 
| 20210603T01:16:00Z | CVE-2020-36326 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-36326 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2020-36326 | PHPMailer 6.1.8 through 6.4.0 allows object injection through Phar Deserialization via addAttachment with a UNC pathname. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2018-19296, but arose because 6.1.8 fixed a functionality problem in which UNC pathnames were always considered unreadable by PHPMailer, even in safe contexts. As an unintended side effect, this fix eliminated the code that blocked addAttachment exploitation.| 
| 20210603T00:08:19Z | CVE-2021-29208 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-29208 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2021-29208 | A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.| 
| 20210603T00:08:14Z | CVE-2020-22023 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-22023 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2020-22023 | A heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerabililty exists in FFmpeg 4.2 in filter_frame at libavfilter/vf_bitplanenoise.c, which might lead to memory corruption and other potential consequences.| 
| 20210603T00:08:11Z | CVE-2020-22022 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-22022 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2020-22022 | A heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability exists in FFmpeg 4.2 in filter_frame at libavfilter/vf_fieldorder.c, which might lead to memory corruption and other potential consequences.| 
| 20210603T00:08:07Z | CVE-2021-32625 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-32625 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2021-32625 | Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. An integer overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer (on 32-bit systems ONLY) can be exploited using the `STRALGO LCS` command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. This is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-29477 which only addresses the problem on 64-bit systems but fails to do that for 32-bit. 64-bit systems are not affected. The problem is fixed in version 6.2.4 and 6.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to use ACL configuration to prevent clients from using the `STRALGO LCS` command.|
