| 20220708T11:11:29Z | # Relay-Attack-Unit-for-cars-with-keyless-systems Many new cars now have keyless entry systems, or can have them added as an upgrade. This allows the driver to open and start the car without using a button or turning a key so long as the fob is nearby.  Thieves are exploiting this, using relay attack technology to hack into every car with keyless%s computer, meaning they don’t even need a key-fob to start the vehicle and can drive it away in a matter of seconds.A relay attack usually involves two people working together. One stands by the targeted vehicle, while the other stands near the house with a device that can pick up a signal from the key fob.The device then relays the key fob’s signal directly to the car, allowing the thieves to get in and drive away immediately. The price of 1 unit is 1,000 euros. Here%s a video of how it works : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAaG7Rs5zKw | https://github.com/nonamee71/Relay-attack-for-keyless-cars | 0 | 0|
