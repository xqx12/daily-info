Fuzzing them one by one is a tedious task, not to mention the false positives we obtain in those results. To solve this problem I created Lazy FuzzZ. It fuzzes all those urls, removes all false positives and sends only legitimate results to burpsuite. | https://github.com/th3hack3rwiz/Lazy-FuzzZ | 2 | 0|
