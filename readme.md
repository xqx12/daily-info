| 20210718T16:56:41Z | CVE-2021-22893 | Proof-of-Concept (PoC) script to exploit Pulse Secure CVE-2021-22893.  | https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2021-22893 | Pulse Connect Secure 9.0R3/9.1R1 and higher is vulnerable to an authentication bypass vulnerability exposed by the Windows File Share Browser and Pulse Secure Collaboration features of Pulse Connect Secure that can allow an unauthenticated user to perform remote arbitrary code execution on the Pulse Connect Secure gateway. This vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.| 
| 20210718T16:23:04Z | CVE-2021-21315 | systeminformation | https://github.com/MazX0p/CVE-2021-21315-exploit | The System Information Library for Node.JS (npm package %systeminformation%) is an open source collection of functions to retrieve detailed hardware, system and OS information. In systeminformation before version 5.3.1 there is a command injection vulnerability. Problem was fixed in version 5.3.1. As a workaround instead of upgrading, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() ... do only allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected.|
