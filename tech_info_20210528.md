| 20210528T23:53:40Z | The generalized normal distribution is ruled by a parameter %beta% and comprises famous distributions, such as normal (beta=2) and Laplace (beta=1). The uniform distribution is also included, as beta diverges. Current implementation in R package gnorm exploits relation with gamma distribution to simulate random draws. This implementation is proner to break down as beta diverges. For beta >= 1, the GN density is log-concave, so I propose a rng based on Devroye%s method. This alternative implementation does not break down as beta diverges. It is also provides an educational example of application for Devroye%s elegant and general method. | https://github.com/mlambardi/gnorm | 0 | 0|
