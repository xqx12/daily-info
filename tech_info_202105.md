| 20210527T02:30:05Z | CVE-2021-21985 | Multiple vulnerabilities in the vSphere Client (HTML5) were privately reported to VMware. Updates and workarounds are available to address these vulnerabilities in affected VMware products. | https://github.com/bigbroke/CVE-2021-21985 | The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to lack of input validation in the Virtual SAN Health Check plug-in which is enabled by default in vCenter Server. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server.| 
| 20210526T18:05:01Z | CVE-2021-22893 | Proof-of-Concept (PoC) script to exploit Pulse Secure CVE-2021-22893.  | https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2021-22893 | Pulse Connect Secure 9.0R3/9.1R1 and higher is vulnerable to an authentication bypass vulnerability exposed by the Windows File Share Browser and Pulse Secure Collaboration features of Pulse Connect Secure that can allow an unauthenticated user to perform remote arbitrary code execution on the Pulse Connect Secure gateway. This vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.|

| 20210526T03:01:08Z | CVE-2020-27216 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-27216 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2020-27216 | In Eclipse Jetty versions 1.0 thru 9.4.32.v20200930, 10.0.0.alpha1 thru 10.0.0.beta2, and 11.0.0.alpha1 thru 11.0.0.beta2O, on Unix like systems, the system%s temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. A collocated user can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. If the attacker wins the race then they will have read and write permission to the subdirectory used to unpack web applications, including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files. If any code is ever executed out of this temporary directory, this can lead to a local privilege escalation vulnerability.| 
| 20210526T03:00:28Z | CVE-2021-28112 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-28112 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2021-28112 | Draeger X-Dock Firmware before 03.00.13 has Active Debug Code on a debug port, leading to remote code execution by an authenticated attacker.|

It may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly unspecified other impact.| 
| 20210526T03:00:18Z | CVE-2021-33570 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-33570 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2021-33570 | Postbird 0.8.4 allows stored XSS via the onerror attribute of an IMG element in any PostgreSQL database table. This can result in reading local files via vectors involving XMLHttpRequest and open of a file:/// URL, or discovering PostgreSQL passwords via vectors involving Window.localStorage and savedConnections.| 
| 20210526T03:00:15Z | CVE-2021-22667 | PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-22667 | https://github.com/JamesGeee/CVE-2021-22667 | BB-ESWGP506-2SFP-T versions 1.01.09 and prior is vulnerable due to the use of hard-coded credentials, which may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access and permit the execution of arbitrary code on the BB-ESWGP506-2SFP-T (versions 1.01.01 and prior).|
