| 20220328T08:02:49Z | Researchers at Bilkent University in Turkey have recently created a small quadruped robot called SQuad, which is made of soft structural materials. This unique robot, presented in a paper published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, is more flexible than existing miniature robots and is thus better at climbing or circumventing obstacles in its surroundings.%We have been working on miniature robots for almost a decade now,% Onur Ozcan, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told TechXplore. %Even though miniature robots have many advantages, such as being cheap, as they require fewer materials, and the ability to access confined spaces, one of their major drawbacks is their lack of locomotion capabilities, especially on uneven terrain.%  Tiny robots tend to get stuck easily while moving in the surrounding environment, as their height does not allow them to climb or avoid obstacles. Ozcan and his colleagues tried to overcome this limitation by implementing a principle known as %body compliance.%  %We thought that by making our miniature robots soft, they would be able to exploit their body compliance to go over obstacles, just like most biological systems like insects or mice do,% Ozcan said.  SQuad, the palm-size and four-legged robot developed by the researchers, is primarily made of soft materials, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The robot also has soft C-shaped legs with integrated DC motors, which enable their rotation. | https://github.com/RichardKristopher/miniature-robot | 0 | 0|

| 20220326T15:08:28Z | During the exploitation phase of a pen test or ethical hacking engagement, you will ultimately need to try to cause code to run on target system computers. Whether accomplished by phishing emails, delivering a payload through an exploit, or social engineering, running code on target computers is part of most penetration tests. That means that you will need to be able to bypass antivirus software or other host-based protection for successful exploitation. The most effective way to avoid antivirus detection on your target%s computers is to create your own customized backdoor. Here is a simple way to evade anti-virus software when creating backdoors! | https://github.com/RoseSecurity/Anti-Virus-Evading-Payloads | 74 | 10|

| 20220328T10:30:28Z |  Conventional trains, using steel wheels on a steel track, could never efficiently climb a track as steep as most funicular railways. Steel wheels are used to decrease rolling resistance, which improves the efficiency of trains on flat ground, but would hinder their ability to get traction going up steep slopes.     The Incline Railway, and funicular railways in general, solve this problem by pulling trains up steep grades with a cable. With this cable, the steel wheels don’t need to have traction, but can be used primarily to guide the train along the tracks. The funicular railway is made even more efficient by counterbalancing two train cars on the same track and using the weight of one to help pull the other up the mountain. The Incline has two cars that ride on the same single mile-long track. When the cars come close together, the track splits into two as a “passing loop” for both cars to pass one another. This single track, passing loop system, is used in funicular railways across the world! | https://github.com/eatlranytolberts/fuzzy-funicular | 0 | 0|
