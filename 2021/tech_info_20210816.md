| 20210816T19:38:06Z | In this project, we use the symbolic execution using angr to analyse x86 binaries which are vulnerable to buffer overflow. We have then used the same to generate a payload for us that will exploit the same. We then used a binary with stack canaries to generate a payload which will evade the protection provided by the canary. Angr is smart enough to create an appropriate payload even if there are variable amount of local variables introduced and hence adjusts as the stack layout changes. | https://github.com/sukritisingh/Exploit-Payload-Generation-Using-Angr | 0 | 0|
