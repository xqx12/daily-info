| 20210716T20:28:56Z | cve-2021-22555 | Null | https://github.com/cgwalters/container-cve-2021-22555 | A heap out-of-bounds write affecting Linux since v2.6.19-rc1 was discovered in net/netfilter/x_tables.c. This allows an attacker to gain privileges or cause a DoS (via heap memory corruption) through user name space|

| 20210716T15:24:16Z | CVE-2021-33560 | Tool to check whether a PGP client is affected by CVE-2021-33560 | https://github.com/IBM/PGP-client-checker-CVE-2021-33560 | Libgcrypt before 1.8.8 and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 mishandles ElGamal encryption because it lacks exponent blinding to address a side-channel attack against mpi_powm, and the window size is not chosen appropriately. (There is also an interoperability problem because the selection of the k integer value does not properly consider the differences between basic ElGamal encryption and generalized ElGamal encryption.) This, for example, affects use of ElGamal in OpenPGP.| 
| 20210716T04:04:35Z | CVE-2021-3493 | CVE-2021-3493 Ubuntu漏洞 | https://github.com/derek-turing/CVE-2021-3493 | The overlayfs implementation in the linux kernel did not properly validate with respect to user namespaces the setting of file capabilities on files in an underlying file system. Due to the combination of unprivileged user namespaces along with a patch carried in the Ubuntu kernel to allow unprivileged overlay mounts, an attacker could use this to gain elevated privileges.|
