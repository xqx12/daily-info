| 20210622T20:22:12Z | We propose Deep Kronecker Neural Network, which is a general framework for neural networks with adaptive activation functions. In particular we proposed Rowdy activation functions that inject sinusoidal fluctuations thereby allows the optimizer to exploit more and train the network faster. Various test cases ranging from function approximation, inferring the PDE solution, and the standard deep learning benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN etc are solved to show the efficacy of the proposed activation functions. | https://github.com/AmeyaJagtap/Rowdy_Activation_Functions | 0 | 0|
