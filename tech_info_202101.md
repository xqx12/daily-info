Python was used to program two classes which setup the state and agent respectively. Q-values are set state-action pairs and the algorithm chooses an optimal action for the current state based on estimates of this value. The reward and next state for this action is observed which allows for the Q value to be updated. Over many epochs this algorithm can learn the best path to take for this problem as long as the strategy balances exploration and exploitation correctly. | https://github.com/ronanmmurphy/Q-Learning-Algorithm | 0 | 0|
