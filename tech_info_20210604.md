| 20210604T23:23:37Z | CVE-2021-21985 | Null | https://github.com/alt3kx/CVE-2021-21985_PoC | The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to lack of input validation in the Virtual SAN Health Check plug-in which is enabled by default in vCenter Server. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server.| 
| 20210604T16:59:25Z | CVE-2021-29155 | Proof of Concept CVE-2021-29155  | https://github.com/Kakashiiiiy/CVE-2021-29155 | An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.x. kernel/bpf/verifier.c performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. Specifically, for sequences of pointer arithmetic operations, the pointer modification performed by the first operation is not correctly accounted for when restricting subsequent operations.| 
| 20210604T15:46:07Z | CVE-2021-28476 | PoC for CVE-2021-28476 a guest-to-host "Hyper-V Remote Code Execution Vulnerability" in vmswitch.sys. | https://github.com/0vercl0k/CVE-2021-28476 | Hyper-V Remote Code Execution Vulnerability|

| 20210604T11:26:42Z | CVE-2021-29447 | Wordpress XXE injection 구축 자동화 및 PoC  | https://github.com/dnr6419/CVE-2021-29447 | Wordpress is an open source CMS. A user with the ability to upload files (like an Author) can exploit an XML parsing issue in the Media Library leading to XXE attacks. This requires WordPress installation to be using PHP 8. Access to internal files is possible in a successful XXE attack. This has been patched in WordPress version 5.7.1, along with the older affected versions via a minor release. We strongly recommend you keep auto-updates enabled.| 
| 20210604T05:57:15Z | CVE-2021-2173 | CVE-2021-2173 | https://github.com/emad-almousa/CVE-2021-2173 | Vulnerability in the Recovery component of Oracle Database Server. Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.0.2, 12.2.0.1, 18c and 19c. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker having DBA Level Account privilege with network access via Oracle Net to compromise Recovery. While the vulnerability is in Recovery, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Recovery accessible data. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 4.1 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N).|
