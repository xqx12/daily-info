This issue was fixed via commit 049c4e13714e (%bpf: Fix alu32 const subreg bound tracking on bitwise operations%) (v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. The AND/OR issues were introduced by commit 3f50f132d840 (%bpf: Verifier, do explicit ALU32 bounds tracking%) (5.7-rc1) and the XOR variant was introduced by 2921c90d4718 (%bpf:Fix a verifier failure with xor%) ( 5.10-rc1).|

| 20210826T12:52:56Z | Use a system call dependency graph to detect malware and analyze their behavior. The system calls are extracted and collected by Fredrickson and et al.[1] it contains two sets of benchmarks: the malware and the regular software set. The malware set comprises 2631 samples pre-classified into 48 families and 11 types. The regular software set comprises 35 samples. A dependency graph is built from these system calls and a set of features for each software is extracted to specify the software behavior. A feature selection method is implemented to reduce the number of features by clustering them. Machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks are exploited to build two prediction models. The first model is a two-class model that classifies software into malware and regular software. The second model is a multi-class model, which identifies the type of malware, in addition to classifying the software to malware and regular software.
